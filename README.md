Dear Team,

I have made this assignment using html,css,js. In html  I have used a button, in css I have added few transition and styling for the button, In js part I have used an array of colors, and used the Changecolor() function and called the same function in the html element using 'onclick'
so that when the button is clicked then the function is called each time and used Math.random to get the random index of the array by using the lenght of the array. 'document.body.style.backgroundColor' is used to set the
background color of the body.
